# BAGS, QUEUES, AND STACKS

- Several fundamental data types involve collections of objects
- Java’s wrapper types are reference types that correspond to primitive types: Boolean, Byte, Character, Double, Float, Integer, Long, and Short correspond to boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, and short, respectively.

# Bags

- A bag is a collection where removing items is not supported—its purpose is to provide clients with the ability to collect items and then to iterate through the collected items (the client can also test if a bag is empty and find its number of items).

---

# FIFO queues.

- A FIFO queue (or just a queue) is a collection that is based on the first- in-first-out (FIFO) policy.
